            The purpose of a national flag is to symbolize a nation. These flags are typically designed with specific meanings for its colours and symbols in mind. With this website we want to introduce you to these flags and their meanings. Further on we also want to add basic data to the countries, which the flags represent (i.e. population size, GDP and so on).
            <h2>What makes a good flag?</h2>
            A good place to start is probably Ted Kaye's "Good Flag, Bad Flag", which outlines five basic principles to make a great flag:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Keep It Simple.</strong>  The flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Meaningful Symbolism.</strong>  The flag’s images, colors, or patterns should relate to what it symbolizes.</li>
                <li><strong>Use 2 or 3 Basic Colors.</strong>  Limit the number of colors on the flag to three which contrast well and come from the standard color set.</li>
                <li><strong>No Lettering or Seals.</strong>  Never use writing of any kind or an organization’s seal.</li>
                <li><strong>Be Distinctive or Be Related.</strong>  Avoid duplicating other flags, but use similarities to show connections.</li>
            </ul>
